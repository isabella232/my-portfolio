import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a passionate programmer with over 14 years of experience in Salesforce.com(9+ yrs), Python, Node.js and Java. I love solving problems and never back off from learning to solve them in a better way.

My biggest strengths are rapid learning, adapting, and an ability to foresee challenges. 10 years from now, I see myself as a Technical Architect handling large-scale projects.
