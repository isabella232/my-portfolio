It hosts a simple portfolio and blog whose content is managed via markdown posts in this repo.

It is built using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
